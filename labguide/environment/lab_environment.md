# Lab environment

In the Poldrack Lab, we want all of our lab members to feel valued,
appreciated, safe, and free to be who they are. We embrace diversity and
are committed to preventing discrimination against people based on
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
religion, age, neurodiversity, disability status, citizenship, or any
other feature that makes them unique.

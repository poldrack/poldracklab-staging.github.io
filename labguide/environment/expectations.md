1.  All researchers in the lab
    are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting, except in cases of
    unavoidable conflict (such as course scheduling).  It generally lasts 1-2 hours
    and all the members are invited to share the main activities of the
    last week. Additional activities at the lab meeting include:
    presentations of research projects or data; talks by external
    speakers; discussions of specific research papers; code reviews in
    which a lab memberâ€™s code is reviewed online with a focus on
    refactoring.   
2.  All members of the
    information technology team are expected to attend the weekly IT
    meeting.
3.  Dr. Poldrack relies primarily
    upon email for communication, and generally responds quickly to
    emails unless traveling or away from work.  He expects lab members to
    respond to emails within one business day unless they are away from
    work (even if the response is simply to acknowledge receipt of the
    message).

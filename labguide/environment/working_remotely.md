1.  The Poldracklab has a long
    history of remote members, and we support the needs of lab members
    who must work remotely.   
2.  Any remote work must be
    discussed with and approved by Dr. Poldrack and arranged in
    accordance with [<span class="s1">Stanford University Policies on
    Staff Telecommuting and Remote
    Working</span>](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-20).

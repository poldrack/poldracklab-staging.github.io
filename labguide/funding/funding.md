# Funding

## How are postdocs in the lab funded?

- Most postdocs in the lab are
    funded through postdoctoral fellowships or grants that they write
    themselves.  
- Some postdocs are funded
    through existing grants. In this case, the postdoc must spend a significant portion of
    their time working on that project. However, the lab also provides
    postdocs the room to develop their own ideas.

We have the opportunity to
    request [Diversity
    Supplements](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-20-222.html)
    for our NIH grants. If you qualify for such a fellowship (which
    includes individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups,
    disadvantaged backgrounds, or rural/low-income areas), please
    contact Dr. Poldrack to discuss your interest.

The fundamental mission of our lab is to understand how human brain
computations give rise to decisions and actions, with a particular focus
on how humans exert control over their behavior. We use a broad set of methods,
including neuroimaging, behavior, and computation. We are committed to
doing our work in as transparent and reproducible way as possible, and
in building tools and resources to help other researchers achieve these
aims as well. We aim to
sustain a laboratory community in which everyone feels welcomed,
respected, and intellectually stimulated.

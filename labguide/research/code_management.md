# Code management and sharing

## Code management

- All code should be managed using
a version control system, preferably git.

- Code should be regularly pushed
to a remote server, preferably github.

- All code should be associated
with an open source license.

-   - By default we prefer
    maximally permissive licenses, such as the MIT license.

- Any substantive code copied or
adapted from another source (e.g. stackoverflow) should be attributed to
the source

-  Care must be taken to avoid
sharing private passwords, AWS Credentials, and other confidential
information when using Github. Any accidental breach should be dealt
with and reported to Russ and other relevant parties immediately.l.

## Code review

- All coding projects should be
    reviewed prior to paper submission.

## Code sharing

- All code should be made available
via github, upon submission of the preprint at the latest.
- All code should be accompanied by
an open source license.
   - Our general preference is for
    permissive licenses such as MIT or Apache, but other licenses may be
    used (e.g. in collaborative projects that use GPL-style licenses).
- A release should be generated for
any submission, containing the exact code used to implement all of the
included analyses.   
- The github repository should be
connected to Zenodo in order to generate a DOI for each release, and
this DOI should be included in the manuscript.

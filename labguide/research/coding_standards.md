# Coding standards

- Code should be readable

- All lab members should be
familiar with principles of readable coding:
   - [Art of Readable Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781449318482/)
   - [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)

- Code should be modular
   - Functions should do a single
    thing that is clearly expressed in the name of the function
   - Functions should include a
    docstring that clearly specifies input and output

- Code should be portable
   - Any absolute paths should be
    specified as a variable in a single location, or preferably as a
    command line argument
   - Any required environment
    variables should be clearly described
   - Any non-standard requirements
    (e.g. Python libraries not available through PYPI) should be
    described with instructions on how to install

- Important functions should be
tested

# Pre-registration

- All empirical projects will be
pre-registered, preferably using the Open Science Framework.

   - Pilot studies need not be
    pre-registered, but should then be subject to a pre-registered
    replication or extension.

- Pre-registration should include
as much detail as possible.

- Pre-registration must include at
minimum:

- Sample size (with justification)

- Inclusion/exclusion criteria

- Criteria and procedures for
outlier exclusion and data transformation

   - Even if you can’t say exactly
    how you will do it, outline your procedures for determining how to
    do it

- Primary hypotheses or outcomes to
be tested (or an explicit statement that the study is simply
exploratory)

- In some cases, multi-stage
pre-registration may be appropriate

   - E.g. when an initial
    discovery sample is used to determine hypotheses for subsequent
    testing in a validation sample
   - In this case, the initial
    pre-registration should lay out the sampling plan and procedures for
    data splitting, as well as the plan for followup pre-registrations.

- For fMRI studies,
pre-registration should specify:

   - Any anatomical regions of
    interest to be used (with a specific definition and/or image mask
    for the region)
   - Motion modeling strategies
    (including trial- or subject-level exclusion criteria)
   - Confound modeling strategies
    at the trial-, subject- and group-level (including the specific
    design of response time modeling strategies)

- Deviations from pre-registration

   - Pre-registration should not
    be viewed as handcuffs. If a detail of the pre-registration is clearly suboptimal,
    then the rationale for using a more appropriate method should be
    noted, and the optimal method should be used.
   - Publications should include
    an explicit “Deviations from pre-registration” section that outlines
    any deviations and their rationale.

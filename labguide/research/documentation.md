# Documenting research activities

- Detailed procedures should be
    documented throughout any ongoing research activities, including
    subject recruitment procedures, subject running procedures, analysis
    plans, and readmeâ€™s for any code base. Documentation should be
    sufficient to allow a new researcher or research coordinator to be
    able to understand any ongoing research procedures with minimal
    (ideally no) additional guidance from other research staff.
- This documentation should be
    ready to be made available to Dr. Poldrack or other lab members at
    any time, preferably via an online platform such as Google Docs.

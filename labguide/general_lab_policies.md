## Administrative requests

The assigned administrative
    assistant for the lab (currently Renee Schumm) should be the default
    person to send any administrative requests. In the past, we have had
    issues where requests were coming from multiple members of our lab
    and/or to multiple administrative staff, which was not being
    sufficiently mindful of time and busy schedules of the
    administrative staff. Therefore, in general, you should not directly
    contact other departmental administrators with requests unless
    directed by the administrative assistant or Dr. Poldrack. However,
    there may be exceptions to this that justify contacting other staff
    directly (e.g., CNI-related questions directly to CNI staff like
    Laima Baltusis).  

## Onboarding

New members of the lab will be provided with a detailed list of
    onboarding procedures as well as access to the labâ€™s Google Drive
    which contains internal lab documentation.

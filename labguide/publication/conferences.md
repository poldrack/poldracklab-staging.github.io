- The laboratory will generally
fund the attendance of members to at least one conference per year,
pending funding availability. 
  - While funding is usually tied
    to presenting at the meeting, in some cases the lab will fund
    members to attend who are not presenting, depending on the meeting
    location and funding availability.
   - We regularly fund the
    attendance of research assistants to conferences as we think this is
    an essential aspect of their training experience.
- Conference abstract submissions
must be completed at least one week before the final deadline, to allow
coauthors sufficient time to review the submission.
- Lab members are encouraged to
find satellite opportunities (such as hackathons or workshops) to
maximize the benefit of their conference travel.
- Conferences we attend (roughly in
order of frequency):
  - Organization for Human Brain
Mapping (our primary meeting)
  - Cognitive Computational
Neuroscience
  - Society for Neuroscience
  - Psychonomic Society
  - Neuroeconomics
  - FLUX
  - Cognitive Neuroscience Society

- We affirm the importance and
    value of engaging with non-expert audiences, and support the efforts
    of lab members in service of science communication. We encourage lab
    members to work to develop their science communication skills and to
    seek out opportunities to engage with the public about science.
- In some cases, laboratory
    findings may be of sufficient public interest to warrant a
    University press release. In these cases we will work with the Universityâ€™s public
    relations team to develop a press release.  In our interactions with the
    public relations team, we will express our intent to not exaggerate
    or oversimplify the findings.
- If we are contacted by
    members of the press about our research, we will try to make
    ourselves available for comment to the extent possible. We will work
    to use accessible language while also communicating the nuances of
    our work. We may ask journalists to send us paraphrased versions of
    our quotes to check them for accuracy before the publication of any
    article, though we recognize that some journalists might not be
    willing to do so.

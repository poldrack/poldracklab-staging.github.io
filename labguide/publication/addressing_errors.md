- If we identify an error in a
    published paper from the lab, all authors should convene promptly to
    discuss what if any conclusions are affected by the error. Most
    journals have a mechanism for either publishing a correction to the
    article when the primary conclusions of the paper are not
    substantially affected, or retracting the article if they are. All
    authors should agree on whether a correction or retraction is
    warranted, and promptly notify the journal of their recommendation
    and the nature of the error. If applicable, a notification and
    corrected version of the article should also be submitted to the
    preprint server (e.g. bioRxiv), and internal copies of the paper
    should be corrected and versioned accordingly.

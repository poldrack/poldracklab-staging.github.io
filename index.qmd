Our lab is focused on understanding how the brain gives rise to adaptive human behaviors.  We use a combination of functional neuroimaging, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling to address this question.  We also develop tools and infrastructure to make neuroscience more transparent and reproducible.

Our ongoing research projects include:

- network attack
- rdoc

Our ongoing tools and infrastructure projects include:

- openneuro
- fmriprep
- mriqc
- cognitive atlas
- neurovault
- neurosynth
